# Multiple-Regression-model-
Regression model with more than one dependent variable to predict independent variable.
In this Salary_Data_1.csv file
YearsExperience	Age	Salary

There are two independent variables.
In linear model only YearsExperience is considered for predicting the Salary whereas in Multiple Regression model both YearsExperience, Age are taken for predicting the Salary.... Thus if more than one variable is used for regression model then it comes under multiple regression.
